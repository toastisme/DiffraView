==================
Refinement
==================

An overview of refinement in DIALS is given `here <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27050135/>`_.
Here different parameters of the experiment are optimised with respect to the observed spot 
locations to obtain the UB matrix that best represents the data. Different parameters 
of the experiment can be fixed if required.
