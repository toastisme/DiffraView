Processing Multicrystal Melamine Tutorial
==================

This tutorial goes through the entire data reduction pipeline using a melamine
dataset from SXD. The data consists of three orientations, with each orientation
containing two crystals.

The GUI consists of two panels. The left panel allows you to visualise your 
experiment in different ways with several viewers, and the right panel allows 
you to apply different algorithms to your experiment. Different viewers/algorithms  
can be selected using the tabs along the top of each panel. More of these become
available to you as you progress through the data processing. The algorithms tabs 
move from left to right to mimic the data processing workflow of moving from importing 
data towards exporting integrated intensities.

To import data, under the import tab click the Browse button. This will open a
file dialog that will allow you to select one or multiple files. If more than 
one file is selected, DIALS treats these files as different orientations of the
same experiment. The melamine dataset consists of three files (one for each orientation),
 and so these are all imported at the same time.

After opening files the output of DIALS is shown on the algorithm panel.
Along the top of the GUI a summary is given of the experiment. The description 
reflects the orientation actively displayed in the Experiment viewer. This will include
more information as you proceed through data processing.

In the Experiment viewer panel the first orientation is shown in detector space. Moving
the mouse over a detector panel in this viewer shows the panel name and 
coordinates. Clicking on a panel generates a line profile along the 
time-of-flight direction in the line plot, shown underneath the Experiment viewer. 
In the Experiment viewer menu (toggled by pressing s), different orientations 
can be shown by selecting from the orientations dropdown menu.

Importing data enables the Find Spots tab in the algorithm panel. 

DIALS has several methods for identifying Bragg peaks. The dispersion algorithms 
are described in 3.1 of `this paper <https://journals.iucr.org/d/issues/2018/02/00/di5011/index.html>`_, 
and `here <https://github.com/graeme-winter/dials_tutorials/blob/main/algorithms/spot_finding.md>`_.
Both of these methods iterate over all pixels, looking at neighbouring pixels to 
determine if the given pixel satisfies a series of thresholds. Strong pixels are
then joined together to define the shoebox of a given reflection. The radial profile
algorithm is described `here <https://github.com/dials/dials/pull/2009>`_. For SXD 
data the default parameters tend to be sufficient.

When setting the ToF range, if a pixel is highlighted in the Experiment viewer the 
line profile will grey out data outside of the range. The image will also update 
on the detector panels of the experiment viewer when the range is updated. 

After running spot finding, the experiment summary is updated and spots are shown 
in the Experiment viewer. The size of these can be changed using the reflection 
size slider in the Experiment viewer sidebar. Bounding boxes can also be viewed from these options. If the line profile is 
showing a pixel that forms part of a reflection, the bounding box and centroid 
are now shown in the line profile.

As we now have reflection positions, the Reciprocal Lattice viewer is enabled. 
This shows reflection centroids in reciprocal space. As in the experiment viewer,
orientations are coloured based on their orientation. These can be selectively 
hidden by using the Orientations dropdown in the Reciprocal Lattice viewer 
sidebar. In our case, the reciprocal lattice is a mixture of two crystals and so 
currently looks disorded, but this will be fixed after we obtain unit cells in 
the indexing stage. Along the bottom of the Reciprocal Lattice viewer are buttons 
that change how the reflections are coloured. In the Orientation View, reflections 
are coloured based on their orientation, whereas in the Crystal View, reflections 
are coloured based on which unit cell they are assigned to. As we currently have 
no indexing solution, all reflections will be greyed out in the Crystal View.

In the top left corner, information about the reflections can be viewed directly
 via the Reflection Table button. When looking at the Experiment viewer,
clicking on a reflection in the reflection table will rotate the Experiment viewer to show
its position on the detector (and vice versa). Any reflections can be removed 
manually be right-clicking on the reflection in the Reflection Table. 

We now have positions of observed reflections, and so can move onto indexing. 

DIALS supports several indexing algorithms for detecting periodicity. An overview
of the different approaches is given `here <https://journals.iucr.org/d/issues/2018/02/00/di5011/index.html>`_.
An initial space group and unit cell can be given, however for both the 1D and 3D
FFT methods can also be run with no initial guess. If no initial values are given 
the resulting unit cell will be in P1. As part of indexing some initial refinement 
is done for the obtained UB matrix. Selecting Optimize Detector Panels Separately 
will allow the position and orientation of individual panels to be optimised, as opposed to 
treating the entire detector as one rigid body. As with spot finding, default parameters 
should be sufficient for this dataset. However, as we know we have two crystals 
we can specify this by entering `max_lattices=2` under the Advanced Options section. 


After indexing has completed, the indexed reflections are shown in the Experiment
and Reciprocal Lattice viewers. In both viewers indexed reflections are now shown in 
red. Calculated reflections can be viewed by enabling them in either viewer sidebar. 
Clicking on a reflection in the Experiment viewer will now show its Miller index in the line profile 
(indices also be seen in the Reflection Table). In the Reciprocal Lattice viewer, 
the reciprocal cell can be viewed, again using the viewer sidebar. We can now see 
the cells that were obtained in indexing. The parameters for the corresponding unit 
cells are given in the experiment summary. Now when switching ti Crystal View in the 
Reciprocal Lattice viewer, reflections are coloured based on which reciprocal cell they 
have been assigned. By selecting crystal frame in the Reciprocal Lattice viewer sidebar 
reciprocal cells are aligned, giving a much clear picture in this multicrystal case.

As we now have an indexing solution, we can use the Experiment Planner viewer to plan 
additional orientations. In the bottom right corner a dmin value can be specified by 
the user. By clicking calculate, predicted reflections at that resolution are then calculated 
for using the asymmetric unit of each indexing solution for each orientation already loaded. 
After the first orientation has been calculated reflections from additional 
orientations are only displayed if the Miller indices are not already observed.
 Hence each orientation shows the number of additional unique miller indices that 
 could be observed at a given resolution.

After calculating predicted reflections for the current orientations, moving 
the φ slider in the viewer sidebar shows how many additional unique reflections 
would be observed at subsequent orientations. The Next Best button calculates this 
across all angles in 5° increments. The Store button keeps the current orientation, 
allowing the user to explore another, or search for the next best orientation after the 
current one.

The current solution for both unit cells is in P1 (this can be seen in the 
experiment summary at the top of the screen). Under the Index tab, symmetry 
can be applied by clicking the Detect Symmetry button. After selecting which 
crystal to work on, a number of solutions will be proposed at differing levels 
of symmetry, along with the corresponding errors that are introduced. In this case 
5 solutions are suggested. Selecting a solution will update all indexing for 
relevant reflections, and update the unit cell both in the Reciprocal Lattice viewer 
and the experiment summary. This process can then be repeated for the other crystal.

With our updated unit cells, we can now carry out further refinement of these 
solutions under the Refine tab. As in the Index tab the choice can be made to 
allow each panel to optimise separately or together as one rigid body. In addition, 
different parameters of the model can be fixed during refinement. 

The final step is to obtain integrated intensities using the calculated spot 
positions from our refined model. These intensities are obtained by calculating 
bounding boxes for each calculated reflection, estimating the foreground and background 
areas of each reflection, and summing these via direct summation or profile fitting, in both 
cases with the background subtracted. Bounding boxes along the x and y directions are 
estimated based on the variance of observed reflections, whereas the time-of-flight 
dimension is set by the user. To get an idea of a reasonable time-of-flight bounding 
box size, and the performance of different profile fitting methods, the Integration 
Profiler viewer can be used.  

When the Integration Profiler viewer is open, the performance of the different 
integration methods for a given reflection can be observed by opening the reflection 
table and clicking on a reflection. Different initial parameters can be set for a 
given algorithm, and the calculation rerun by pressing the Calculate button.

Before running integration with a selected algorithm, corrections can be applied 
to the data. These include the Lorentz correction, subtracting an empty run and 
normalising with respect to a Vanadium run, and applying a spherical absorption 
correction. These can be applied by using the Apply Corrections button and selecting the 
desired options.

After integration has completed, successful reflections can be viewed in the Experiment 
and Reciprocal Lattice viewers by selecting the integrated reflections checkbox in the viewer sidebar. 
The resulting intensities can then be saved as an hkl file using the Save HKL button under the Integration tab.
